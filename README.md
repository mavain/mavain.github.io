# Iwado
*The Game That Nobody Plays*
## What is Iwado?
Iwado is a game that I've been working with on/off for the past year. I originally created it to be a clone of Don't Starve, though I believe my coding abilities are much to be desired.

### Todo (in no particular order)
1. Make lifecycles for the trees (functionality was added previously, but removed because of glitches)
2. Add health to objects
3. Possibly make simple AI?
